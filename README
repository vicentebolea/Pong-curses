Pong-curses

Pong-curses is a PingPong game written in C with NCURSES lib. I did it when i was in my first year of my major. So maybe is
too simple. The reason because i did this repository is to try github. But if you want to help me to make a better code,
i'll be glad.

!!How to compile!!

You maybe have to install ncurses library. So to install tip:

	$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev 

Go to its directory and tip:

	$ cc pong.c -lncurses -o pong 

Then:

	$ ./pong 

!!How it works!!

Firstly i used a struct like a class, so the struct called "objeto" have 5 members:
Struct objeto:
	Member x-coordenada called 'x'
	Member y-coordenada called 'y'
	Member counter of puntuation called 'c'
	Member move vertical called 'movver'
	Member move horizontal called 'movhor'
And is also four var of objetos:

objeto's var
	First stick called 'b1
	Second stick called 'b2'
	The ball called 'b'
	The screen called 'scr'
